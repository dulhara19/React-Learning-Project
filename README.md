<h1> important facts </h1>

```

function App() {

const returnfunction = (event) => {
console.log(event.target.value);}

return (

 <div className="containerdiv">
<h1>my react app</h1>
<Studentcard obj={obj} />
<input
        type="text"
        id="text2"
        onChange={returnfunction}
        className="inputfield"
      />
</div>

) }
```

when input feils sent to the html page when it calls the App.js file, it will show you the input field in the web page. and when i create this input, i added
onChange={returnfunction} this is an event handler that triggers a function whenever the value of an input field, textarea, or other form element changes. it calls for {returnfunction}

then this is my {returnfunction},
const returnfunction = (event) => {
console.log(event.target.value);} this will show whatever types on input field, inside the console.

<h1> useState</h1>

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Counter;
```

we need to re render actual dom. therefore we need to use this. here i have created counter.jsx file. it imports {useState} from react.

1. useState(0) initializes count with 0.
2. count stores the current counter value.
3. setCount is a function to update count and trigger a re-render.

<h1>callback functions</h1>

Since props are one-way (parent â†’ child), we can't directly send data from a child to a parent using props. Instead, we use callback functions (a function passed as a prop from the parent) to send data back to the parent.

<h1>callback functions-filter results from child component</h1>

in here i created dynamic-stu-card component which shows the filtered results. it uses props to get data and display the view according to the received data.

````
const studentcard2 = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="stucard-container">
      <h1>Student Card</h1>
      <div className="stucard">
        <h2>{props.name}</h2>
        <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
        <p>Country: {props.country}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And when the data is extracted from the child component(input feild). i send that data from child component to parent App.js using hooks.then stored it as "searchtext" then, i use that data to filter the data and display as dynamic student card component(studentcard2) here i have mentioned the structure of studentcard2. Also i have created list of hardcoded data which we need to compare search data with.

```
 //list of array to dynamic-stu-card
  const studentList = [
    { lastname: "Anne", age: 25, hometown: "colombo" },
    { lastname: "Borer", age: 20, hometown: "gampaha" },
    { lastname: "Alex", age: 24, hometown: "kandy" },
  ];
```

after that, we need to filter the data given from search bar. so here is the filtering part

```
 //filtering the studentList array based on the search text
  const searchstulist = studentList.filter((student) =>
    student.lastname.toLowerCase().includes(searchtext.toLowerCase()),
  );
  ```
